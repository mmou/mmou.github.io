Warble is a rust library for an AEAD protocol using the Strobe cryptographic framework. The Strobe cryptographic framework is a sponge construction that supports a variety of symmetric cryptographic operations based on a single primitive, the Keccak block function. "Strobeâ€™s main design principle is that the cryptographic output from any step depends not only on any keys, but also on all preceding inputs." (https://strobe.sourceforge.io/papers/strobe-latest.pdf)

For a bit more context on the use case for Warble, the initial intention was to use it for a secure p2p file sharing project in order for a sender to send a file in encrypted and authenticated blocks over UDP, an unreliable transport. The Warble implementation was largely guided by [this spec](https://strobe.sourceforge.io/examples/aead), but in addition, Warble allows for AEAD communication over an unreliable transport protocol. To support this, we introduce session ids and per-message counter nonces, whereby after applying a session id to the Strobe transcript, we clone the transcript and add a nonce for every message we want to send/receive. Warble maintains a shifting nonce window per session to prevent replay attacks.

Warble assumes that key exchange has already taken place; the Strobe framework enables protocol composition with ease.
