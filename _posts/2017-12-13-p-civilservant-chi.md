# CivilServant 

repo: [CivilServant](https://github.com/mitmedialab/CivilServant)

I contributed mainly from Summer 2016 - Fall 2017. [Dr. J. Nathan Matias](https://natematias.com) and I wrote and presented a paper titled [CivilServant: Community-Led Experiments in Platform Governance](https://natematias.com/media/Community_Led_Experiments-CHI_2018.pdf) at [CHI 2018](https://medium.com/@natematias/remaking-large-scale-behavioral-research-for-democracy-new-paper-at-chi-2018-4569ee17f07a).

In 2019, the [CivilServant](https://civilservant.io) nonprofit became the [Citizen and Technology (CAT) Lab](https://citizensandtech.org/).
