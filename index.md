*********
I'm **Merry Ember Mou**, a security software engineer interested in usable security and applied cryptography.

<br>
I currently work at [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) on end-to-end encryption. Previously, I worked on [Keybase](http://keybase.io), built global internet scanning data collection pipelines at the network security company [Expanse, Inc.](https://www.expanse.co/), and contributed to a software platform for large-scale citizen science of online community moderation policies with [CivilServant](https://civilservant.io/). I completed my computer science undergrad and masters at MIT.
