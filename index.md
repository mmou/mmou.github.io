I'm **M Ember Mou**, an engineer interested in privacy-respecting systems and security for humans.

<br>
I currently work at [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) on end-to-end encryption. Until recently, I worked on [Keybase](http://keybase.io). Previously, I built global internet scanning data collection pipelines at the network security company [Expanse, Inc.](https://www.expanse.co/) and contributed to a software platform for large-scale citizen science of online community moderation policies with [CivilServant](https://civilservant.io/). I completed my computer science undergrad and masters at MIT.
