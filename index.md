I'm **Merry Mou**, an engineer interested in privacy-preserving systems and security for humans.

<br>
Since Oct 2019, I work at [Keybase](http://keybase.io). Previously, I built global internet scanning data collection pipelines at the network security company [Expanse, Inc.](https://www.expanse.co/) and contributed to a software platform for large-scale citizen science of online community moderation policies with [CivilServant](https://civilservant.io/). I completed my computer science undergrad and masters at MIT.
